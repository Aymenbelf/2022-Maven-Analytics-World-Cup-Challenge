# Qatar-world-CUP-Challenge-
 participated in the 2022 Maven Analytics World Cup Challenge and created a Power BI dashboard to analyze Qatar's performance.
 The dashboard focuses on Tunisia's World Cup history, their qualification journey for the 2022 tournament, and world cup results
 I used some  various charts and cards to visualize their past appearances, win/loss ratios, and qualification matches against key opponents.
 The dashboard provided insights into Tunisia's overall strength and weaknesses they already faced in the World Cup
